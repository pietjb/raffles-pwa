# Payment Confirmation Email Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added automated payment confirmation email functionality that opens the user's email client (Gmail or default mail app) with a pre-populated professional confirmation message when marking a payment as received.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend Changes (app.py)

#### Updated Function: `update_payment_status()`
- **New Parameter:** `sendEmail` (boolean)
- **Logic:**
  - Updates payment status as before
  - When `sendEmail=true` is passed and payment is marked as paid
  - Returns buyer and raffle data in response
  - Frontend uses this data to generate mailto: link
- **Returns:** Payment status update + optional buyer/raffle data

### 2. Frontend Changes (script.js)

#### Updated Function: `togglePaymentStatus()`
- **New Behavior:**
  - When marking payment as received, shows confirmation dialog
  - Dialog asks if user wants to send confirmation email
  - Lists what will be included in the email
  - If "Yes" selected:
    - Receives buyer and raffle data from backend
    - Formats professional email body with all details
    - Opens Gmail web interface (desktop) or default email app (mobile)
    - Email pre-populated with subject and body
- **Mobile Detection:**
  - Detects mobile devices
  - Uses `mailto:` for mobile (opens default mail app)
  - Uses Gmail web for desktop (opens in new tab)
  - Fallback to `mailto:` if popup blocked

### 3. Email Generation (Client-Side)

#### Email Content Created:
- Subject: "Payment Confirmed - [Raffle Name]"
- Body includes:
  - Personalized greeting
  - Payment confirmation message
  - Raffle entry details (name, tickets, amount)
  - All ticket numbers (formatted as #123456, #789012)
  - Prize description
  - Draw date (formatted as "November 30, 2025")
  - Good luck message
  - Contact information

#### Formatting:
- Text-based with emoji section headers
- ASCII box drawing characters for sections
- Clear visual separation
- All information included
- Professional tone

### 4. Cache Updates
- Updated `script.js` version to v8
- Updated `sw.js` CACHE_VERSION to 8
- Ensures users get latest changes

## Email Content
