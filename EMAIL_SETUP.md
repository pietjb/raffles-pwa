- üé´ All their ticket numbers
- üí∞ Total amount paid
- üèÜ Prize details
- üìÖ Draw date

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Copy Environment File
```bash
copy .env.example .env
```

### Step 2: Configure Email Settings

#### For Gmail (Recommended for Testing)

1. **Enable 2-Step Verification**
   - Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security
   - Enable 2-Step Verification if not already enabled

2. **Generate App Password**
   - Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Select "Mail" and your device
   - Copy the 16-character password generated

3. **Update .env file**
   ```
   SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
   SMTP_PORT=587
   SENDER_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
   SENDER_PASSWORD=xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
   SENDER_NAME=Your Raffle Organization
   ```

#### For Other Email Providers

**Outlook/Hotmail:**
```
SMTP_SERVER=smtp-mail.outlook.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SENDER_EMAIL=your-email@outlook.com
SENDER_PASSWORD=your-password
SENDER_NAME=Your Raffle Organization
```

**Yahoo Mail:**
```
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.mail.yahoo.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SENDER_EMAIL=your-email@yahoo.com
SENDER_PASSWORD=your-app-password
SENDER_NAME=Your Raffle Organization
```

**Custom SMTP Server:**
```
SMTP_SERVER=mail.yourdomain.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SENDER_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
SENDER_PASSWORD=your-smtp-password
SENDER_NAME=Your Organization
```

### Step 3: Install Required Package (if needed)
The email functionality uses Python's built-in `smtplib` library, so no additional packages are required.

### Step 4: Set Environment Variables

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
$env:SMTP_SERVER="smtp.gmail.com"
$env:SMTP_PORT="587"
$env:SENDER_EMAIL="your-email@gmail.com"
$env:SENDER_PASSWORD="your-app-password"
$env:SENDER_NAME="Your Raffle Organization"
```

**Windows (Command Prompt):**
```cmd
set SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
set SMTP_PORT=587
set SENDER_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
set SENDER_PASSWORD=your-app-password
set SENDER_NAME=Your Raffle Organization
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
export SMTP_SERVER="smtp.gmail.com"
export SMTP_PORT="587"
export SENDER_EMAIL="your-email@gmail.com"
export SENDER_PASSWORD="your-app-password"
export SENDER_NAME="Your Raffle Organization"
```

### Step 5: Test the Configuration
1. Start your Flask application
2. Mark a test buyer's payment as received
3. Choose "Yes" when prompted to send confirmation email
4. Check if the email was sent successfully

## Usage

### Sending Payment Confirmation
1. Go to the Buyers section of a raffle
2. Find the buyer whose payment you've received
3. Check the "Payment Received" checkbox
4. A dialog will appear asking if you want to send a confirmation email
5. Click "OK" to send the email, or "Cancel" to skip

### Email Content
The confirmation email includes:
- Personalized greeting with buyer's name
- Raffle name and details
- Number of tickets purchased
- Complete list of ticket numbers
- Total amount paid
- Prize description
- Draw date (formatted nicely)
- Professional HTML formatting with colors and styling

## Troubleshooting

### "Email not configured" Error
- Make sure environment variables are set
- Restart your Flask application after setting variables
- Verify the `.env` file exists and contains correct values

### Authentication Failed
- For Gmail: Use App Password, not regular password
- Verify email and password are correct
- Check if 2-Step Verification is enabled (required for Gmail)
- Try generating a new App Password

### Email Not Received
- Check spam/junk folder
- Verify buyer's email address is correct
- Check Flask console for error messages
- Ensure SMTP server and port are correct

### "SMTP Connection Error"
- Check your internet connection
- Verify SMTP server address and port
- Some networks block port 587; try port 465 (SSL) instead
- Check firewall settings

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit .env file to version control**
   - Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file
   
2. **Use App Passwords**
   - Never use your actual email password
   - Generate app-specific passwords when possible

3. **Limit Access**
   - Only give email credentials to trusted administrators
   - Use a dedicated email account for the raffle system

4. **Production Deployment**
   - Use environment variables provided by your hosting platform
   - Don't store credentials in code or config files
   - Consider using environment secrets management

## Optional: Load from .env File

To automatically load environment variables from `.env` file, you can use `python-dotenv`:

```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```

Then add to the top of `app.py`:
```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()  # Load environment variables from .env file
```

This is already included in your `requirements.txt` file.

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the Flask console for detailed error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Test with a simple email first
4. Check email provider's SMTP documentation
5. Ensure email account allows "less secure apps" or use App Passwords
